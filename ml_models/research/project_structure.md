# Food Label Analysis: A Multi-Algorithm ML Approach

## Research Problem Statement
**"Intelligent Food Safety Assessment: A Multi-Algorithm Approach for Ingredient Analysis and Health Risk Prediction"**

### Problem Identification
- Manual food label reading is time-consuming and error-prone
- Consumers lack nutritional knowledge for informed decisions
- Need for automated, accurate food safety assessment system

### Research Objectives
1. **Product Name Extraction**: Train CNN+LSTM model for product name identification
2. **Text Classification**: Develop multi-class classifier for label sections (ingredients, nutrition, brand)
3. **Nutrition Analysis**: Create ensemble model for health risk prediction
4. **Performance Comparison**: Compare 6 ML algorithms for optimal accuracy

### Hypotheses
- **H1**: CNN+LSTM outperforms traditional OCR for product name extraction
- **H2**: Random Forest > Decision Tree for ingredient classification
- **H3**: XGBoost > Linear models for nutrition risk prediction
- **H4**: Ensemble methods improve accuracy by >10%
- **H5**: Deep learning models achieve >90% accuracy on food labels
